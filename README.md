# LatticeFold
A proof-of-concept implementation of the LatticeFold folding scheme, engineered by [Nethermind](https://nethermind.io), based on the work [LatticeFold: A Lattice-based Folding Scheme and its Applications to Succinct Proof Systems](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/257) by Dan Boneh and Binyi Chen.

## Project Overview

LatticeFold implements a lattice-based folding scheme for succinct proof systems. It combines advanced cryptographic techniques to reduce the complexity of proofs while maintaining security and efficiency. This implementation demonstrates the potential of lattice-based cryptography for succinct proof systems.

### Applications
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Prove knowledge of a statement without revealing the statement itself.
- **Verifiable Computations**: Allow a verifier to confirm the correctness of computations without re-executing them.

The project is supported by the Ethereum Foundation ZK Grant and is intended for research and experimentation, not production use.

### Key Features
- **Ajtai Commitment Scheme**: Provides cryptographic commitments.
- **R1CS/CCS Structures**: Facilitates succinct circuit representations.
- **Fiat-Shamir Transcript**: Adds non-interactive proof capabilities.

**DISCLAIMER:** This is a proof-of-concept prototype, and in particular has not received careful code review. This implementation is provided "as is" and NOT ready for production use. Use at your own risk.

## Building
### Prerequisites
- [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to manage toolchains.
- Use `rustup` to install the nightly toolchain pinned to `nightly-2024-11-05`:
  
   ```bash
   rustup install nightly-2024-11-05
  ```
- The [rust-toolchain](https://github.com/NethermindEth/latticefold/blob/main/rust-toolchain) file pins the version of the Rust toolchain, which the LatticeFold library builds with, to the specific version `nightly-2024-11-05`.
### Instructions
- Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NethermindEth/latticefold.git
cd latticefold
```
- After that, use `cargo`, the standard Rust build tool, to build the library:
```bash
cargo build --release
```
## Troubleshooting
- Verify the correct toolchain is set using `rustup show`.
- Run `cargo update` to fetch the latest compatible dependencies.
- For platform-specific issues, consult the Rust documentation.
## Usage
Import the library to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
latticefold = { git = "https://github.com/NethermindEth/latticefold.git", package = "latticefold" }
```

Available packages:
- `latticefold`: main crate, contains the non-interactive folding scheme implementation, together with the Ajtai commitment scheme, R1CS/CCS structures, Fiat-Shamir transcript machinery, etc.
- `cyclotomic-rings`: contains the trait definition of a ring suitable to be used in the LatticeFold protocol, a few ready-to-use rings and short challenge set machinery.

## Examples

- Check [latticefold/examples/README.md](latticefold/examples/README.md) for examples.
- Run an example using Cargo:
```bash
cargo run --example example_name
```


## Frontends

Currently, the only way to define a circuit to be folded is by specifying it as a [rank-1 constraint system (R1CS)](https://github.com/NethermindEth/latticefold/blob/main/latticefold/src/arith/r1cs.rs) - a representation of arithmetic circuits using degree-2 constraints or a [customizable constraint system (CCS)](https://github.com/NethermindEth/latticefold/blob/main/latticefold/src/arith.rs) - flexible circuit definitions that can handle constraints of any degree.

## Acknowledgments

- This project is built on top of [our fork](https://github.com/NethermindEth/stark-rings) of [lattirust library](https://github.com/cknabs/lattirust) originally developed by [Christian Knabenhans](https://github.com/cknabs) and [Giacomo Fenzi](https://github.com/WizardOfMenlo). 
- We adapted [the sumcheck protocol from Jolt](https://github.com/a16z/jolt/blob/fa45507aaddb1815bafd54332e4b14173a7f8699/jolt-core/src/subprotocols/sumcheck.rs#L35) to the ring setting. 
- A lot of definitions are directly transferred from [sonobe](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/sonobe) library. 
- The implementation is supported by Ethereum Foundation [ZK Grant](https://blog.ethereum.org/2024/06/25/zk-grants-round-announce).
